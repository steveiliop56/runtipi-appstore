# Runtipi appstore

This is just my own version of the official [Runtipi appstore](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi-appstore) with various apps configured in the best way possible.

> [!WARNING]
> This is just a personal repository for my own setup, you are free to use it on your own homelab but I cannot guarantee support and I am not responsible for any data loss caused by an update to any of the apps in this repository.

## Deprecated apps policy

Due to this repository being an experimental one, deprecated apps will not remain here forever. I can guarantee that I will not remove any deprecated apps for at least one (1) month. After this time period, the deprecated app ID may be used in another app.
