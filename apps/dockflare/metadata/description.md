# Dockflare

DockFlare simplifies Cloudflare Tunnel and Zero Trust Access policy management by using Docker labels for automated configuration, while also providing a powerful web UI for manual service definitions and policy overrides. It enables secure, hassle-free public access to both Dockerized and non-Dockerized applications with minimal direct interaction with Cloudflare. Acting as a dynamic, self-hosted ingress controller, DockFlare offers persistent, UI-driven control over access policies centralizing and streamlining your access management.

## Features

-   **Unified Cloudflare Tunnel Management**:
    -   Automates Tunnel creation/use & `cloudflared` agent lifecycle (optional internal deployment or external).
-   **Dynamic Ingress via Docker Labels**:
    -   Auto-configures Tunnel ingress & DNS from Docker labels (e.g., `hostname`, `service`, `path`).
    -   Supports various service types (`http`, `https`, `tcp`, `ssh`, `rdp`, `http_status`).
    -   Controls `no_tls_verify` and `originServerName` (SNI) for origin connections.
-   **Manual Ingress Rule Management**:
    -   Add & manage public hostnames for non-Docker services (e.g., router, NAS) via Web UI; DockFlare handles Tunnel rules & DNS.
-   **Versatile Access Policy Control (Docker & Manual)**:
    -   Define Cloudflare Access Policies (e.g., `bypass`, `authenticate`, custom JSON) via Docker labels; auto-manages Access Applications.
    -   Web UI to manage/override policies for *any* rule; UI changes persist, override labels, with revert option & clear indicators.
-   **Multi-Hostname & Multi-Zone**:
    -   Supports multiple hostnames (unique targets, zones, policies) per Docker container (indexed labels) or manual rule.
-   **State Persistence & Graceful Deletion**:
    -   Configurable grace period for Docker rule cleanup; persists all managed rules, Access App IDs, & UI overrides in `state.json`.
-   **Intelligent Reconciliation**:
    *   Continuously syncs Docker, manual entries, & saved state (respecting UI overrides) with Cloudflare (Tunnel, DNS, Access Apps); shows UI progress.
-   **Comprehensive Web UI (DaisyUI)**:
    -   **Dashboard**: Tunnel/agent status & controls.
    -   **Unified Rule List**: View/manage all rules (Docker & manual) with status, target, Access Policy (Cloudflare links, UI override badges), & delete options.
    -   **Easy Manual Entry**: Add non-Docker services via UI.
    -   **Account Tools**: View account tunnels/DNS.
    -   **Real-time Logs & Themes**: SSE activity logs & multiple UI themes.
-   **Secure & Robust**:
    -   Content Security Policy (CSP), API retries, and error reporting.
